A dashboard for rovers on Mars.

09:00 - 16:00

first we used web sockets and composed the API on the backend, but we got into some trouble and at the last moment switched it to short polling on the frontend.

The front-end is made with Vue

That's not a question, and the API is probably shut down

No, it isn't. Sorry to disappoint you

Yes, two even
